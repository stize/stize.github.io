**Rebirth**, this is the wish for this new adventure. It has been many years that we have worked creating code, capturing ideas, improving our way of coding, etc. This time it's time to start a new adventure that we hope to share in a different way.

## What does Stize mean?

Stize does not have a particular meaning, but rather represents an idea. The idea of putting together under a development platform all the knowledge that the team that makes up Stize has accumulated over the years

## Why Open Source?

Stize was created under the idea that everything that is included should be free for the community to use. Many other Open Source libraries are incorporated into Stize and, why not share this philosophy?

## But, what is Stize?

Is it a framework? Is a set of libraries? Is it an architecture? Well, none of them. We like to consider that Stize is a **development kit**, it is the tools with which we develop applications. Yes, it provides some custom libraries or even custom templates with predefined architecture, but with the help of well known existing frameworks and tools. Stize is your toolset.

> In the world of development there are no *silver bullets*.

## Whatâ€™s next?

Currently we have released the base for development on .NET 5 (libraries and the first template), soon we will enrich with web technologies (javascript, angular, react, vue ...), other languages (java, go, node ...) and development tools (CLI, templates, IaC ...)
